Advantages of multi-stage-build
	Results in a light-weight Docker image
	Does not require the build tool or JDK to be installed on the host machine beforehand (Docker controls the build process)
	Integrates well with services that automatically “just build” using the present Dockerfile
	Only artifacts we need are copied from one stage to the next (i.e., our application’s dependencies are not packaged into the final image as in the previous method)
	Create as many build stages as you need

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Stop at any particular stage on an image build using the –target flag, i.e.
	docker build --target MAVEN_BUILD -t anna/docker-multi-stage-build-demo:1.0-SNAPSHOT .
