Routes (Ingress): For external access to services, routes expose services to external networks using DNS. Ingress controllers manage incoming traffic and route it to the appropriate services.

Persistent Storage: OpenShift provides storage options for stateful applications using Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).

4. OpenShift-Specific Components:
OpenShift Router: Manages incoming HTTP/TCP traffic and routes it to the appropriate service.

OpenShift Registry: A container image registry for storing and managing Docker-formatted container images. It is often integrated with Red Hat Quay.

OpenShift Console: A web-based graphical user interface for interacting with and managing OpenShift clusters.

Operators: Introduced with OpenShift 4, Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing applications on OpenShift. They automate common operational tasks.

Red Hat Identity Management (IdM): Provides centralized identity management services, including authentication and authorization.

5. Tools and Interfaces:
OpenShift CLI (oc): A command-line interface for interacting with OpenShift clusters.

Web Console: A graphical user interface that provides a visual representation of the OpenShift cluster and allows users to perform various tasks.

High-Level Interaction Flow:
Developer Workflow:

Developers use the OpenShift CLI (oc) or the web console to interact with the OpenShift cluster.
They create applications using YAML files (manifests) that define services, deployments, and other resources.
Control Plane Actions:

The API server processes requests and updates the etcd store accordingly.
Controllers (e.g., Deployment Controller) take actions based on changes in the cluster's desired state.
Node Actions:

The scheduler decides where to place pods based on resource requirements and constraints.
Nodes run the containers and communicate with the control plane.
Application Runtime:

Pods and services handle the runtime aspects of applications, such as execution, scaling, and communication.
This overview provides a high-level understanding of the OpenShift architecture. The components and interactions may evolve with new releases, so it's advisable to refer to the official OpenShift documentation for the most up-to-date information.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Organizing resources in OpenShift
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Understanding projects
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	In OpenShift, a project is a way to organize and manage resources within a specific namespace. Projects provide a logical boundary for resources, allowing users to isolate and group their work. Here are key aspects of projects in OpenShift:

1. Namespace Isolation:
In OpenShift, the term "project" is synonymous with a Kubernetes "namespace." A project provides a way to isolate and organize resources within a cluster.
Each project has its own namespace, and resources within a project are isolated from resources in other projects.
2. Resource Management:
Resources in OpenShift, such as pods, services, routes, and deployments, belong to a specific project.
Projects help manage and organize resources based on different applications, teams, or purposes.
3. Access Control:
Projects are associated with role-based access control (RBAC) policies. RBAC allows administrators to control which users or groups have access to resources within a project.
Users can be assigned roles (e.g., admin, editor, viewer) within a project, determining their level of access.
4. Quotas and Limits:
Projects can have resource quotas and limits to control the amount of compute resources (CPU and memory) that can be consumed by the resources within the project.
Quotas help prevent resource exhaustion and ensure fair resource distribution.
5. Networking:
Projects have their own network namespace, allowing for isolation in terms of network policies, services, and routes.
Network policies can be applied at the project level to control the communication between pods within the same project.
6. Project Creation:
Users with the necessary permissions can create projects using the OpenShift Web Console or the OpenShift CLI (oc command).
When a project is created, a corresponding Kubernetes namespace is also created.
7. Switching Between Projects:
Users can switch between projects using the OpenShift CLI or the OpenShift Web Console.
Switching to a different project allows users to work within the context of that project, viewing and managing resources specific to it.
8. Developer and Multi-Tenancy:
Projects facilitate a multi-tenant environment, enabling multiple teams or users to share the same OpenShift cluster while maintaining resource isolation.
Each project can represent a development environment, a team's work, or a specific application.
9. Integration with OpenShift CLI and Web Console:
The OpenShift CLI (oc) provides commands for managing projects, including creating, deleting, and switching between projects.
The OpenShift Web Console includes a "Projects" section where users can view and manage existing projects.
10. Default Project:
By default, OpenShift clusters include a project named "default," which is the initial project for resources if no project is specified.
Users can create additional projects to organize their work based on different criteria.
Example Commands:
Creating a Project:



oc new-project <project-name>
Switching to a Project:



oc project <project-name>
Listing Projects:



oc get projects
Deleting a Project:



oc delete project <project-name>
Projects are a fundamental organizational unit in OpenShift, providing a way to structure and manage resources within a Kubernetes cluster. They offer isolation, access control, and resource management features that are essential for creating multi-tenant environments and organizing workloads effectively.
