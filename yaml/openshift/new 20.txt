Adv. of ARO
------------
1. Enterprise ready orchestration 
2. Stringent security and compliance
3. Direct access and visibility to control plane.

Dis adv. of ARO compared to other k8s options 
---------------
1. Installation and maintainance is more challenging.
2. Cost 
3. Scaling and Flexibility of o/s 
4. Node count limited.

Pre-req
-------

1. Increase quota limit if required.
	Subscription + "Usage +quota" ->
		Search 
			DSv3	- 50 
			FSv2	- 40 
			
			
	Master and worker node configuration 
		3 master nodes * 8 vcpus = 24 vcpus 
		3 worker nodes * 4 vpcus = 12 vcpus
		1 bootstrap vm - 4 cores 
	
2. Azure roles 
	Contributor or User Access Admin or Owner
	
	Subscription + IAM
	
3. Microsoft entra role: App Admin (Global admin has it)
	Entra ID 

4. Resource providers registered: 
	Microsoft.RedHatOpenShift
	Microsoft.Compute 
	Microsoft.Storage 
	Microsoft.Authorization 
	
	Subscription + Resource providers 
	
5. Azure VNet with 2 empty subnets 
	can be automatically created during ARO cluster cretion 
		if azure portal is used.
		
6. A service principal 
	can be automatically created during ARO cluster creation
