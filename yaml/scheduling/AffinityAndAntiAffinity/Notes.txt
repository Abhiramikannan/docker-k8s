
Affinity and anti-affinity
--------------------------
nodeSelector 
	simplest way 
	select or ignore a node
	
Affinity and anti-affinity
	gives more control
	Node affinity 
		like nodeSelector 
		more expressive 
		can specify soft rules.
			e.g. 
				Inter-pod affinity/anti-affinity.

Two types of Affinity
	requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: 
		scheduler 
			can't schedule Pod 
				unless the rule is met. 
	preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: 
		scheduler 
			tries to find a node 
				that meets the rule. 
		If no matching node 
			scheduler still schedules the Pod.
